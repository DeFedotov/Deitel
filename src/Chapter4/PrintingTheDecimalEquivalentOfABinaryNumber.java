/*  4.31 (Printing the Decimal Equivalent of a Binary Number)
	Write an application that inputs an
	integer containing only 0s and 1s (i.e., a binary integer) and prints its decimal equivalent. [Hint: Use
	the remainder and division operators to pick off the binary numberâ€™s digits one at a time, from right
	to left. In the decimal number system, the rightmost digit has a positional value of 1 and the next
	digit to the left a positional value of 10, then 100, then 1000, and so on. The decimal number 234
	can be interpreted as 4 * 1 + 3 * 10 + 2 * 100. In the binary number system, the rightmost digit has
	a positional value of 1, the next digit to the left a positional value of 2, then 4, then 8, and so on.
    The decimal equivalent of binary 1101 is 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 8, or 1 + 0 + 4 + 8 or, 13.]
